# Php_SQL_project
This is my Project for PHP/SQL course at Laurea University of applied sciences. Goal was to create simple php image gallery.

[Update]: Fixed the paths in links etc.


# Installation

1. Install xampp

2. Download the .zip from Github

3. Extract the folder to xampp/htdocs

4. Start xampp, and then start apache and sql

5. Go to phpMyAdmin and create a database "php_database"

6. Import the createtables.sql file from sql directory.

7. Now the databse is set, next check what port is xampp using: Apache -> config -> Apache(httpd.conf)

8. Now to start using the app go to 127.0.0.1:*your port number*/*foldername*/index.php
  Note: foldername is the folder which you place in xampp/htdocs

9. Start using the App!

Enjoy!
